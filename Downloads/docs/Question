Perfect 👏 — that’s the right mindset for your review call.
You’re not just showing that you read the deck — you’re showing you understand the technical flows and are thinking about implementation, sequencing, and impact from the Data Distributor (DD) side.

Here’s how I’ll structure it for you:
	•	I’ll list each of the 16 key architectural points (the same ones we covered earlier).
	•	Under each, I’ll give 3 sharp, developer-level questions (so 48 total).
	•	They’ll be phrased exactly like you’d ask them in a project discussion — clear, technical, and relevant to your role in the DD team.

⸻

🧩 1️⃣ Data Ingestor → Data Distributor Flow
	1.	How does the Data Ingestor signal to DD that a file is ready — through an event or direct file drop?
	2.	Do we have retry logic if an ingested file fails schema validation in DD?
	3.	Should DD re-ingest data if Data Ingestor reprocesses the same file (duplicate handling)?

⸻

🧩 2️⃣ Entity Matching & DD UUID Generation
	1.	What’s the exact matching logic — deterministic (LE #) or fuzzy (demographics)?
	2.	How do we prevent duplicate DD UUID creation for the same external entity if matching thresholds change?
	3.	Is there a service or library for matching logic, or is it inlined within DD codebase?

⸻

🧩 3️⃣ OnePAM External LDD – First Initial Upload
	1.	Since the LDD is empty, how are create failures tracked — via OIL responses or event capture?
	2.	Should DD block subsequent uploads until all events from the first upload are reconciled?
	3.	Is the create sequence fully synchronous or partially async (given 8–10M records)?

⸻

🧩 4️⃣ OnePAM External LDD – Subsequent Initial Uploads
	1.	What’s the rule for deciding between create vs update when matching with DD Store?
	2.	How does DD detect attribute priority differences between overlapping uploads (e.g., Operating Site vs LE)?
	3.	Are relationship creations (e.g., LE–OS) retried independently if OnePAM rejects one side?

⸻

🧩 5️⃣ Daily Upload Pattern (OIL Path)
	1.	What’s the file size threshold for daily OIL uploads — is batching configurable?
	2.	How is OnePAM notified that a batch upload is complete and validated?
	3.	Do we have an SLA for the delay between file creation and OIL ingestion?

⸻

🧩 6️⃣ Daily Upload Pattern (API Path)
	1.	Who controls the switch between file-based (OIL) and API-based (FACT) mode?

	3.	How are API response errors (per record) logged back to the DD Store’s Error Table?

⸻

🧩 7️⃣ Refresh Process Using DD UUID

⸻

🧩 8️⃣ Data Refresher (DRF) & Unite Data Lake (UDL)
	1.	How frequently will DRF pull data from UDL for refresh comparison?

	3.	Does DD handle the delta creation logic or rely fully on DRF output?

⸻

🧩 9️⃣ Data Reconciler (DRC) – Main vs External Sync
	1.	What’s the trigger for DRC execution — timed job, event, or manual run?
	2.	How do we detect whether an External LDD update should propagate to Main LDD or not?
	3.	Will DRC send its updates back through DD, or directly to OnePAM?

⸻

🧩 🔟 Notifications & Event Processing
	1.	What’s the expected volume of OnePAM Notifications DD must handle per day?
	2.	Are notifications idempotent — how do we avoid processing the same event twice?
	3.	Where are event processing failures retried — inside DD or via MADP event bus?

⸻

🧩 11️⃣ Error Table / Logging / Reconciliation
	1.	How long are error table entries retained for manual correction?
	2.	Do we have tooling for reprocessing specific failed DD UUIDs?
	3.	Can reconciliation metrics (success, timeout, failure %) be automatically exported?

⸻

🧩 12️⃣ Performance & Throughput
	1.	Are we still capped at 3–5 TPS for OnePAM APIs, or has GCDM confirmed 25 TPS?
	2.	How does DD throttle outgoing requests when multiple upload types run concurrently?
	3.	Can DD parallelize per PartyType safely without breaking OnePAM dependency order?

⸻

🧩 13️⃣ Sole Trader & LE Representative Modelling
	1.	Is there a final OnePAM decision on how Sole Traders are represented (Individual vs Organization)?
	2.	How does DD identify if a Sole Trader is already modeled as Individual to avoid duplicate creation?
	3.	Does LE Representative creation depend on Legal Entity creation timing?

⸻

🧩 14️⃣ Parallel Execution & Sequencing
	1.	When multiple initial uploads run (LE, OS, Incapable), what’s the enforced sequence?
	2.	Can DD pipeline the next upload while notifications from the previous one are still pending?
	3.	How do we isolate partial failures when two uploads overlap on the same object?

⸻

🧩 15️⃣ Data Validation & Attribute Priority
	1.	Where is the attribute priority matrix (source-of-truth per attribute) defined — DD config or external?
	2.	Does DD skip attribute updates if values are identical but source timestamps differ?
	3.	How are numeric vs categorical attribute changes handled in diffing logic?

⸻

🧩 16️⃣ Monitoring, Retries, & Operations
	1.	Who owns operational dashboards — DD team or MADP Ops?
	2.	Do we have automated retry pipelines for failed batches (OIL or API)?
	3.	What’s the rollback strategy if OnePAM processing corrupts a batch?

⸻

✅ Total: 48 questions (3 × 16)
They’re all developer-focused, deeply tied to DD’s technical flows, and perfect for asking during architecture or design review.

Would you like me to now sort them into categories (e.g., data ingestion, matching, upload logic, error handling, performance, etc.) for easier reference during your meeting?



Perfect — so now you want general (non-developer, high-level) questions, still aligned with the 16 architecture points, but framed as what a project member or system analyst might ask in review discussions — focusing more on clarity, intent, dependencies, and impact rather than code or logic.
