Understood.

Below are 3 sharp, non-repetitive, architect-level questions for every slide group I gave you earlier.

They are framed to show deep understanding, critical thinking, and awareness of dependencies — exactly what impresses domain architects.

You can pick any 10–12 tomorrow, but I’m giving all groups fully covered.

⸻

✅ PART 1 — HIGH-LEVEL ARCHITECTURE

⸻

Slide Group 1 — Context & Business Requirements

(Types of data, ingestion, DI, OnePAM/MADP split)

Three Questions

	1.	How do we ensure consistency when different external suppliers provide conflicting values for the same Party attributes?

	2.	What governance mechanism defines which attributes belong to OnePAM vs MADP, and how do changes to that split get ratified?

	3.	Are there any attributes from the suppliers that OnePAM will reject or normalise differently, and do we need pre-standardization in DI to minimise upload failures?

⸻

Slide Group 2 — Upload vs Update Phases

Three Questions

	1.	What specific validation must complete successfully in the External LDD before we can reliably start Main updates?

	2.	In what scenarios would we skip the Update phase even if an External upload completes?

	3.	Does OnePAM provide transaction-level atomicity for External → Main transitions, or must DD manage partial failures?

⸻

Slide Group 3 — Constraints (Volume, Multiplication, Time Windows, OnePAM TPS limits)

Three Questions

	1.	What is our defined upper boundary for acceptable throughput on OnePAM before we risk throttling or rejections?

	2.	Do we have a fallback plan if the initial load exceeds the quiet-hour thresholds or runs past maintenance windows?

	3.	Which constraint is considered the highest architectural risk for Phase 1 and why?

⸻

Slide Group 4 — Mitigation Strategies

Three Questions

	1.	Is there a clear approval from GCDM on pre-generating UUIDs for parallelization, or do we need to design both paths for safety?

	2.	If filtering unchanged attributes is a key mitigation, what level of supplier noise (redundant/unnecessary unchanged values) do we currently expect?

	3.	How will we measure whether the phased rollout actually reduces risk or pushes complexity downstream?

⸻

Slide Group 5 — DD Principles & Functional Architecture

Three Questions

	1.	For policy management in DD, which roles will be allowed to modify survivorship and overwrite rules — central architects or data stewards?

	2.	Is DD-UUID expected to remain stable across all future data sources or can we foresee scenarios where source-specific UUIDs must be retained?

	3.	How are notification failures from OnePAM escalated — do we retry, reconcile later, or block downstream processing?

⸻

Slide Group 6 — Generic End-to-End DD Flow (Preprocess → Upload → Postprocess)

Three Questions

	1.	What matching tolerance thresholds will be used during entity matching — exact, fuzzy, or weighted multi-field?

	2.	If OnePAM returns partial success on batch updates, how should DD decide between rollback vs forward-fix?

	3.	How do we ensure idempotency when a file is re-delivered or replayed?

⸻

Slide Group 7 — DRF & DRC (Refresh & Reconcile)

Three Questions

	1.	For DRF, if a full refresh contains attribute regressions (old data), how do we prevent overwriting newer values in External?

	2.	For DRC, what is the expected SLA for comparing UDL extracts versus triggering updates in OnePAM Main?

	3.	Does DRF/DRC require versioning of historical files for audit, or is UDL snapshotting considered sufficient?

⸻

✅ PART 2 — UP TO ONEPAM EXTERNAL LDD UPLOAD

⸻

Slide Group 8 — Phased Approach (Phase 1 → 2 → 3)

Three Questions

	1.	What criteria define “Phase 1 complete” — successful initial load, stable daily deltas, or stakeholder sign-off?

	2.	If MADP onboarding (Phase 3) is delayed, do we foresee any data divergence risks between OnePAM and MADP?

	3.	Will the architecture support mixed-mode operation where some flows use External-only and some use both External & Main?

⸻

Slide Group 9 — Upload/Update Patterns (API vs OIL)

Three Questions

	1.	Is there a dynamic rule engine that chooses API vs OIL based on volume, or is this fixed per source?

	2.	What is the max file size we can reliably push via OIL without fragmentation concerns?

	3.	How do we recover from a failed OIL batch when OnePAM partially ingests the file?

⸻

Slide Group 10 — First Initial Upload (Empty External LDD)

Three Questions

	1.	Does OnePAM enforce ordering of Party creation vs Relationship creation, and how does DD handle misordered dependencies?

	2.	Will OIL enforce uniqueness for external UUIDs or must DD pre-validate uniqueness before file creation?

	3.	Is there a required sequence for initial load cutover to avoid double creation during the switch from DI → DD?

⸻

Slide Group 11 — Subsequent Initial Uploads (External already contains data)

Three Questions

	1.	If entity matching yields multiple candidates with similar confidence, does the architect recommend human intervention or automated tie-breaking?

	2.	How should DD react when notifications are delayed significantly beyond SLA — continue, pause, or re-queue?

	3.	What is the preferred strategy for deduplicating overlapping supplier data during subsequent initial uploads?

⸻

Slide Group 12 — Daily Uploads (OIL vs API)

Three Questions

	1.	Should the DD orchestrator dynamically batch small API-based changes to avoid excess calls during high-volume periods?

	2.	What is the expected end-to-end latency for API calls including OnePAM processing time?

	3.	Are there specific Party types (e.g., Bankrupt/Incapables) that OnePAM recommends always via API rather than file?

⸻

Slide Group 13 — Refresh of External LDD (DRF + UDL)

Three Questions

	1.	How do we guarantee the UDL snapshot used by DRF matches the timing of the OnePAM External state to avoid stale comparisons?

	2.	Could DRF generate very large delta files, and do we need throttling before sending them to DD?

	3.	Does the architect foresee future automation to perform DRF runs incrementally rather than full comparisons?

⸻

🎯 If you want, I can also prepare:

	•	Your final curated list of the 10 BEST questions to actually ask tomorrow

	•	A 1-page cheat sheet for the call

	•	A confidence-boosting “what to say in introduction” script

Just tell me, and I’ll prepare it immediately.Understood.
